The inspiration for this post is drawn from this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hscott.net/twitter-contest-winning-as-a-service/">article</a>. 
<br> A truly fun project I just had to try myself, so here it is; my own little version of the Twitter bot.

In order to use this bot, you will first have to sign up for the <a target="_blank" href="https://apps.twitter.com/">Twitter API</a>.
This should only take about 5 minutes. Get your keys, secrets, and token and fill out the required fields in the script.

You can experiment with the amount of time the bot should wait between each retweet/like/follow. 
But I wouldnâ€™t advice you to decrease the sleep timer too much, since a too low sleep timer 
dramatically would increase the likely-hood of Twitter recognizing you as a spam bot;
Which obviously is something you would not want to happen. 

That said, you are free to do whatever you want with the code. Good luck! &nbsp;:four_leaf_clover::four_leaf_clover:
